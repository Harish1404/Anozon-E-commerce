# 1. Base Image: Use a lightweight Python version
FROM python:3.10-slim

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy requirements FIRST (for caching optimization)
# This way, if you change code but not requirements, Docker skips re-installing
COPY requirements.txt .

# 4. Install Dependencies
# --no-cache-dir keeps the image small
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 5. Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# 6. Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# 7. Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "server.py"]
